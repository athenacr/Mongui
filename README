Mongog

Mongog is a graphical interface for viewing and (eventually) editing data in a Mongo DB.

Mongog has a client/server architecture that relies on severaly open-source frameworks that are widely used.






Server

The server is built off of the Sinatrarb framework: http://www.sinatrarb.com/


Requirements

The following ruby gems are required to run the server:

Required Gems:
bson (1.0)
json (1.4.3, 1.2.0)
mongo (1.0, 0.19.1)
rack (1.1.0)
sinatra (1.0, 0.9.4)

Optional gems:
bson_ext (1.0)
mongo_ext (0.19.1)
thin (1.2.7)
yajl-ruby (0.7.5)



Driver File:
By default, the server connects to localhost.  To override this add a file named  'mongo_hosts.dat' in the same directory as mongog.rb.

The file should contain the address of all your Mongo DBs.  One per line.

Running the server:
ruby mongog.rb  - this will run the server on port 4567

ruby mongog.rb -p <PORT>  - run Mongog on a different port.  See the Sinatra link above for more server options.


Client

The ExtJS framework is required to run the client, but is not included with the repo. 

It can be found here:
http://www.extjs.com/

Download and unzip the framework.

Rename the ext-3.2.1 directory 'extjs' and place it in the Mongog/public/lib directory.

Running the client:

Point your browser to http://localhost:4567/mongog.html  after you have the server running. 

If you used the '-p' option when running the server you will need to change the port accordingly.


Usage:

If all is well so far you will see a three-paned webpage appear. 

Left-pane, a drill down of Host/DB/Collection.   Drill down and double click a selection.

Double-clicking takes you to the the 'Collection Data' tab which shows you a few documents from your collection.

To run a query, enter it in the upper pane and press 'Run Query'.  This will change your view to the 'Results' tab and show you your data.

Hot-Keys:
CTRL R - Run Query
CTRL T - New Query Tab


You did it!
